<h1>A short introduction to HTML</h1>
<p>HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is not really a programming language, but rather a way of tagging text so that it can be displayed in an attractive fashion by a web browser (Firefox, Chrome, Edge, Safari, Opera, etc...). A fun experiment to see HTML in action is to visit your favorite website and inspect the source code (Right Click -> View Page Source in most browsers). This will reveal what is sent from the server to your web browser. HTML is simply a long string that is sent by the server and interpreted by your browser. That string is almost always encoded in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8">UTF-8</a>, which is a way of converting characters into 4-8 bit units (bytes or octets), which is the binary data that actually travels across the network. You don't need to worry about the encoding, just about the strings that are being sent from your server to the user using your app.</p>
<p>The best way to start thinking about HTML is to imagine a Word document. In that word document, you might have a single word that is in <strong>bold font</strong>. How does Word know that that single word should be bolded? Well, because behind the scenes, there are tags surrounding that word that indicate that it should be bold. Something like this: <code>This is a &lt;strong&gt;bold&lt;/strong&gt; word.</code> Of course, we don't see all of these tags because it would make it tricky to deal with our word documents. Instead, the User Interface renders the text as we would expect to see it. The tags tell the User Interface <em>how</em> the thing they surround should be displayed. HTML is exactly the same. We have our main text of our website. That text is "marked up" or sections of it are surrounded by tags that tell the browser how that bit of text should be displayed.</p>
<h2>Basic Anatomy</h2>
<p>The basic anatomy of HTML includes an opening tag and a closing tag. Let's take this one: &lt;p&gt; This is an opening tag that marks the beginning of a paragraph. This paragraph that you are reading now is started by this tag. When the paragraph ends, there is a closing tag that looks like this: &lt;/p&gt; This tag marks the ending of a paragraph. Everything between the matching opening and closing tags will be part of the same paragraph and most browsers display a paragraph as a block of text with hard breaks on either side. You'll notice a couple things: first, the human readable characters inside of the greater than and less than signs are intuitive and matching. "p" stands for paragraph. If I want to make something bold, I'd use the tags &lt;strong&gt; and &lt;/strong&gt; where "strong" means the font should be strong, or bold. The web browser reads this tag-pair and displays the text between them in a bold font. The second thing to notice is that the closing tag is the same as the opening tag except it has a "/" character inside it. This is required and almost all tags have an opening and closing tag.</p>
<p>In addition to the opening and closing tags, the opening tag may contain some additional information. For instance, let's look at a link: <code>&lt;a href="www.google.com"&gt;This text between these "a" tags will be a link to www.google.com&lt;/a&gt;</code> 'href="..."' means hyperlink reference. The "a" tag is an anchor tag that anchors a bit of text to some other site. In other words, the "a" tag creates a link to some other location. The extra parameter associated with the "a" tag is "href" and that tells the browser where this link should go. By default, most web browsers display a link as blue, underlined text. You will also see styles, classes, and id's being added to various elements in HTML. These are used to tell the browser what special styling (or font/color/positioning) should be added to the content between the tags. Classes are used to identify a group of elements which will all receive the same styling. Ids are used to identify a particular tag (this paragraph). As you go through the lessons for this week, pay attention to the various tags and parameters that are added to those tags. There won't be a test, and there are plenty of cheat sheets online to help you.</p>
<h2>Types of tags</h2>
<h3>Block level elements</h3>
<p>Block level elements are HTML tags that define blocks of text. These are usually displayed starting on new lines. Paragraphs are an example of a block level element. These elements are used to do the major positioning of the text on the page. For instance, all of the headings on this page are wrapped with some sort of heading tag. These are block level elements and they create a line break before and after the surrounded text. This is important to remember because even if you have line breaks in your HTML document, the only way for the browser to know that the line should be broken is with some sort of block element. So if you were to look at the source of this paragraph, you'd see that right now 






I have six line breaks, but none of those are displayed in the browser because they are within a single paragraph block and I don't have any tags to tell the browser to put in line breaks. This is the hardest thing to get with block elements. If you want a line break, you need to tell the browser either with the &lt;br&gt; tag, which tells the browser to put in a line break here, or by surrounding your text with block level tags.</p>
<h3>Inline Tags</h3>
<p>The other kind of tags are "inline tags." These tags do not tell the browser to create line breaks or a block, but rather effect the styling of a particular bit of text. Links, as you saw above, are inline elements. They tell the browser to put a hyperlink on a particular span of text, but they don't break the line. Strong tags are also inline tags. The more tricky ones are the &lt;button&gt; tag, which turns the surrounded text into a button, like so: <button onclick="alert('You clicked me!');">HI!</button> or image tags, which drop an image into the document. Inline style tags are less frequently used in contemporary web development, I think, because we can do much more effective styling with CSS and block elements.</p>
<h3>Basic Layout of HTML document</h3>
<p>An html document is a file with the .html extension. In general, it's layout is like this:
<pre>
<code style="html">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en"&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
   &lt;title&gt;Document&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
The body of your webpage goes here.
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;  
</code>
</pre>
Everything in between the head tags is not displayed except for the title. That is displayed on the browser tab. The title of this page is "Everyday Coding -- HTML". Everything between the body tags makes up the body of the page that you see in the window. Generally, css, links, and javascript is put into the head of the document and the content you want the user to see, of course, must go in the body section. Older HTML pages might have additional information in the first line, but this sample is the convention for HTML5. 
</p>
<h3>Differences Between Browsers</h3>
<p>One note that's pretty important in thinking about HTML: each browser renders HTML in a slightly different manner, so it's important to test your markup in the major browsers and on various devices. We're not going into design or the complexity of front end development in this class, as that would be the topic of an entire program (WATS). If you are excited about that sort of thing, the sky's the limit, so to speak, and it's a rapidly growing and changing field.</p>
